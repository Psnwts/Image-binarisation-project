# Image-binarisation-project
Image binarisation through network theory (max flow min cut) using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm (FFA)

# Launching the program

First go to ```Image-binarisation-project/src```and execute the following command:

```shell
java Main ../instances/instance.txt 
```

Instances that were used for experimentation are the following:
- exemple.txt
- deuxlunes.txt
- duck.txt
- tou.txt

## Some results
